    <section>
      <h2>By the End of This Course, You Should Be Able To:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up a TypeScript project and write strongly typed code.</li>
        <li>Use TypeScript to annotate variables, functions, and objects.</li>
        <li>Create and use interfaces to define the structure of your data.</li>
        <li>Work with arrays, tuples, and enums in TypeScript.</li>
        <li>Build typed React components that manage state and handle props.</li>
        <li>Fetch and type API responses to ensure data consistency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Practice</h2>
      <p>Take a small project you've written in JavaScript, such as a to-do list app or a weather app, and refactor it into TypeScript. This will reinforce everything you've learned by applying it to a real-world project.</p>
